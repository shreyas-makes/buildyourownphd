# Frontend Development Reminder (Always Apply)

## Before Creating Any UI Components:
1. **Check Brand Guidelines**: Always reference [brand-ui-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/brand-ui-guidelines.mdc)
2. **Use Standard Patterns**: Follow the component patterns in [ui-generation-patterns.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ui-generation-patterns.mdc)
3. **Orange as Accent Only**: Never use orange as a dominant color - only for CTAs, progress, and active states
4. **Work Sans Typography**: Use consistent Work Sans font weights and sizes
5. **Empowering Copy**: Use confident, accessible language that avoids academic jargon

## Speedrail-Specific Reminders:
6. **Leverage Flowbite**: Use enhanced form elements and components (already included)
7. **Tailwind Config First**: Define colors and fonts in config rather than inline styles
8. **80/20 Branding**: Focus on fonts, colors, and navigation for maximum impact
9. **Component Libraries**: Flowbite and Tailwind UI are available - don't reinvent

## Quick Checklist for UI Generation:
- [ ] Orange used sparingly for accents/CTAs only
- [ ] Clean neutral layouts with generous white space
- [ ] Work Sans typography with proper hierarchy
- [ ] Empowering, accessible copy tone
- [ ] Mobile-responsive with touch-friendly elements
- [ ] Professional but approachable feel
- [ ] Flowbite components used for enhanced form elements
- [ ] Colors defined in tailwind.config.js using primary/secondary system
- [ ] Consider gradients for premium feel in headers/buttons

## Common Speedrail Patterns to Remember:
- **Enhanced Selects**: Use Flowbite custom selects instead of native HTML
- **Navigation Flexibility**: Top-right, centered, or sidebar layouts all valid
- **Gradient Accents**: Consider subtle gradients in key UI elements
- **Icon Transitions**: Collapsible navigation with icon-to-text hover states
